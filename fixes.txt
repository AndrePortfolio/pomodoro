1. When I close the page it should logout and next time I open must login.
2. When I stop working session should open a page like great job and some stats,
	with a button with new session if you want to start a new one.
3. Add a feature that if time completes it rings, but the timer continues running.
	a session only really finished if the person closes it.
4. Sound is weird, needs a fiz.
5. with dev tools push the tab up and the entirety of the screen moves up.
